The deployment is using a notebook that work with python
I used Google Colab because is online, free and easy to install packages
So in this plataform you need to create a notebook, upload notebook an select the file "WalmartVG.pynb"
it will open the same code you watch on the repository, in Runtime you run it all, then you need to choose the file of input,
select the file 'result.csv' then it will run the code, in some time will download 2 files,
please allow the download if you want to see the whole process, then the notebook will deploy the task of showing the 4 tasks
you can see it scrolling down, i coul do the same download of the file but i thought it can be too much file transfer.
